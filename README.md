    * Always exercise extreme caution and understand the significant risks involved in automated trading.

3.  **HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS:**
    * Model backtest results and performance diagnostics are based on historical data and simulated conditions. They are **STRICTLY for academic analysis** and do not guarantee or predict future real-world performance.
    * Actual trading results can vary significantly due to factors such as slippage, latency, transaction costs (even if small per share, they accumulate), liquidity, market microstructure, and unforeseen events not present in historical data.

4.  **REGULATORY COMPLIANCE IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY:**
    * **USERS ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THEIR USE OF THIS SOFTWARE COMPLIES WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN THEIR JURISDICTION, INCLUDING SECURITIES LAWS (E.G., THOSE ENFORCED BY THE U.S. SEC), TAX LAWS, AND ANY LICENSING REQUIREMENTS FOR FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES.**

**Project Overview:**

This project presents a **quantitative AI system designed for research into financial market phenomena.** It features a novel two-party veto system for theoretical trade initiation, aiming to explore decision-making under conservative and liberal algorithmic biases.

* **Agent Accuracy: Conservative Agent** - Designed with parameters favoring lower risk and higher conviction.
* **Agent Profit: Liberal Agent** - Designed with parameters allowing for more frequent or aggressive theoretical trade signals.

This system primarily focuses on the theoretical agreement between these two agents to assess potential market opportunities.



For detailed Model Backtest Results, please refer to the `config` files. Each trained model has a paired `config` file displaying its historical diagnostic performance.

## Prerequisites & Setup

To run this application for **research and backtesting purposes**, you will need the following:

1.  **Interactive Brokers (IBKR) Trader Workstation (TWS) API Client:**
    * TWS is Interactive Brokers' proprietary trading platform. This application is designed to interface with the TWS API for **simulated data access and theoretical order generation, strictly within a paper trading or research account.**
    * **Installation:** Ensure you have the TWS application installed and running on your machine. You can download it from the official Interactive Brokers website.
    * **API Port Configuration (Crucial for Research Use):** You must enable API access and configure the correct port within the TWS application.
        * Open TWS.
        * Go to **File > Global Configuration**.
        * Navigate to **API > Settings**.
        * Ensure "Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients" is checked.
        * **CRITICAL: It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to use this software ONLY with a TWS Paper Trading Account. If connecting to a live account, you assume full and sole responsibility for any consequences.**
        * Verify that the "Socket Port" is set to `7497` for paper trading accounts (or `7496` for live, **USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION AND AT YOUR OWN RISK**).
        * **Ensure "Read-Only API" is CHECKED** unless you are deliberately and knowingly configuring for theoretical order placement in a paper trading environment. If you uncheck "Read-Only API" and connect to a live account, you risk unintended live trades.
        * Add your machine's IP address to "Trusted IPs" if you encounter connection issues, although `127.0.0.1` (localhost) is usually sufficient.

2.  **Alpha Vantage API Client with Real-Time Data Stream Subscription:**
    * Alpha Vantage is a provider of financial market data. This application utilizes Alpha Vantage for historical and real-time data feeds necessary for model research and backtesting.
    * **Subscription:** You need an Alpha Vantage API key. Ensure your subscription plan includes access to real-time data streams for comprehensive research.
    * **API Configuration for Real-Time Data:** Configure your API key to allow for real-time data streaming. Refer to Alpha Vantage's documentation for details.

## Environment Configuration

Before running the program, you need to set up your API keys as environment variables:

1.  **Rename `production.env` to `.env`:**
    * In the root directory of this project, you will find a file named `production.env`. Rename this file to `.env`.

2.  **Add Your API Keys to `.env`:**
    * Open the newly renamed `.env` file.
    * Add your `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY` and any other required API keys (e.g., for TWS if it uses an API key, though TWS typically uses connection via socket port) in the following format:

    ```
    ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY="YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY_HERE"
    # Add other keys as needed, e.g., for TWS if applicable
    ```
    * Replace `"YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual key.

## Installation Steps

Open your terminal or command prompt and follow these steps:

1.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

2.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    * **Linux/Mac:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    * **Windows Powershell:**
        ```powershell
        venv\scripts\activate.ps1
        ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    * With the virtual environment activated, install all required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Program (For Research & Backtesting Only)

Once all prerequisites are met and dependencies are installed:

1.  **Run the Main Program:**
    ```bash
    python exe.py exe_params.json
    ```
    * This command starts the main execution script, using `exe_params.json` for its parameters.
    * **Remember: All interactions with brokerage APIs should be configured for paper trading accounts or read-only access for research purposes.**

## Automation and Monitoring (Critical Caveats)

This program, when initiated, is designed to automate the process of fetching real-time data for model input and for generating theoretical trading decisions. If configured to interface with a trading platform with execution capabilities (e.g., TWS with "Read-Only API" unchecked), it will attempt to execute orders based on its internal logic.

**HOWEVER, PLEASE BE AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL POINTS:**

* **UNMONITORED AUTOMATION IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS:** Bugs, unexpected market conditions, API disconnections, or system errors can lead to unintended consequences, including unclosed positions, significant losses, or erroneous order placements.
* **CONSTANT MONITORING IS ESSENTIAL:** If you use this software in any automated fashion, it is **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to continuously monitor the program's activity and your brokerage account (preferably a paper trading account)** to prevent unforeseen issues.
* **PORTFOLIO LIQUIDITY WARNING:**
    * The `exe_params.json` file contains `order_quantity` settings. Be advised that the model, as implemented, may not fully factor in fixed transaction fees (e.g., $2.00) in its profitability calculations for individual orders, assuming profitability scales linearly with reasonable position size (around 5-200 shares).
    * **It is YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to manage your capital, position sizing, and risk parameters within `exe_params.json` to prevent over-leveraging or disproportionate transaction costs relative to trade size.** This project does not provide capital management advice.
